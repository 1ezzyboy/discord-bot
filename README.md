# discord-bot
This is a readme file for the discord bot
Currently working on transferring code to python

Bot functionality ideas
1. Twitter webhooking to pull profiles and maybe posts
2. E621 webhooking to pull pictures based on searching tags
3. Music bot features (YouTube linking to play music)
